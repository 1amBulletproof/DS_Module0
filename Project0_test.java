Purpose of program:
Drive a program which reads file input (numbers) and outputs the numbers to a new file as their string representation
i.e. input = 0 1 2 3 4 output = "zero" "one" "two" "three" "four"

Implementation goals:
1. Use GIT to version the project (command line, github app, and netbeans integration)
2. Use Sublime Text & Netbeans extensively to familiarize with both
3. Use 1 class as a driver
4. Use 1 class as for I/O (modified version of provided example)
5. Use 1 class as a queue
6. Use 1 class as a "converter" from a number to a string for outputting
7. Use runtime metrics
8. Use good error & exception handling
9. Use Javadoc (built in java documenting tool?)
10. Use standard java practices & procedures
